 * This reads the current MSB of the PIT counter, and
 * checks if we are running on sufficiently fast and
 * non-virtualized hardware.
 *
 * Our expectations are:
 *
 *  - the PIT is running at roughly 1.19MHz
 *
 *  - each IO is going to take about 1us on real hardware,
 *    but we allow it to be much faster (by a factor of 10) or
 *    _slightly_ slower (ie we allow up to a 2us read+counter
 *    update - anything else implies a unacceptably slow CPU
 *    or PIT for the fast calibration to work.
 *
 *  - with 256 PIT ticks to read the value, we have 214us to
 *    see the same MSB (and overhead like doing a single TSC
 *    read per MSB value etc).
 *
 *  - We're doing 2 reads per loop (LSB, MSB), and we expect
 *    them each to take about a microsecond on real hardware.
 *    So we expect a count value of around 100. But we'll be
 *    generous, and accept anything over 50.
 *
 *  - if the PIT is stuck, and we see *many* more reads, we
 *    return early (and the next caller of pit_expect_msb()
 *    then consider it a failure when they don't see the
 *    next expected value).
 *
 * These expectations mean that we know that we have seen the
 * transition from one expected value to another with a fairly
 * high accuracy, and we didn't miss any events. We can thus
 * use the TSC value at the transitions to calculate a pretty
 * good value for the TSC frequencty.
